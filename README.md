# RetroDrop


RetroDrop is a portable program that supports any audio source (Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, Winamp...)<br/>
It is based on BeatDrop from Maxim Volskiy, so it's 100% compatible with any presets created with MilkDrop and projectM.<br/>
RetroDrop does everything that MilkDrop2 can do, I will be only listing on this page the additional new features :)<br/><br/>

If you want MilkDrop 3, go and get that, I just wanted to work on the code for my own amusement.

### Presets

The preset files define the visualizations via pixel shaders and Milkdrop-style equations and parameters.

The RetroDrop does not ship with any presets. The varying preset packs can be found in separate repositories in the projectM repository list:

- [Base Milkdrop texture pack](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-milkdrop-texture-pack) - Recommended for
  use with _any_ preset pack!
- [Cream of the Crop Pack](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-cream-of-the-crop) - A collection of about 10K
  presets compiled by Jason Fletcher. Currently, projectM's default preset pack.
- [Classic projectM Presets](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-projectm-classic) - A bit over 4K presets
  shipped with previous versions of projectM.
- [Milkdrop 2 Presets](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-milkdrop-original) - The original preset
  collection shipped with Milkdrop and Winamp.
- [En D Presets](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-en-d) - About 50 presets created by "En D".
