# RetroDrop


RetroDrop is a portable program that supports any audio source (Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, Winamp...)<br/>
It is based on BeatDrop from Maxim Volskiy, so it's 100% compatible with any presets created with MilkDrop and projectM.<br/>
MilkDrop3_retro does everything that MilkDrop2 can do, I will be only listing on this page the additional new features :)<br/><br/>

If you want MilkDrop 3, go and get that, I just wanted to work on the code for my own amusement.
